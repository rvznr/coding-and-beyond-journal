        <p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong> continues to evolve as new threats emerge in an increasingly digital world. In 2025, organizations must prepare for sophisticated cyberattacks, advancements in security technologies, and the growing importance of a proactive security culture. Understanding these trends is crucial to safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Rise of AI-Driven Threats</h2>
        <p>Cybercriminals are leveraging AI to develop advanced phishing attacks, malware, and ransomware. These AI-driven threats are harder to detect and more adaptive than traditional methods. To counteract them, organizations are adopting AI-powered threat detection and response systems.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h2">Zero Trust Architecture</h2>
        <p>Zero Trust has emerged as a foundational principle in cybersecurity. By assuming no entity is trustworthy by default, this model ensures strict identity verification and limited access to critical systems. Zero Trust is becoming the standard for safeguarding networks against insider threats and external attacks.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h2">Cloud Security Challenges</h2>
        <p>The widespread adoption of cloud services has introduced new vulnerabilities. Organizations are focusing on enhancing cloud security by employing multi-factor authentication, encryption, and regular audits. Ensuring data privacy in shared environments is a top priority for businesses worldwide.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h2">The Role of Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>While quantum computing holds promise for solving complex problems, it also poses risks to traditional encryption methods. Cybersecurity experts are exploring quantum-resistant algorithms to protect sensitive data in the post-quantum era.</p>
